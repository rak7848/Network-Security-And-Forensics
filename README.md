# Network-Security-And-Forensics

The laboratory sequence examines network security along with forensics by enabling students to operate with multiple network security tools across contemporary network infrastructure. Manual exercises within these labs teach students about network monitoring fundamentals as well as attack simulation practices together with protective measures for network vulnerabilities.

Lab 2: NetFlow and Syslog Analysis

Students conduct Network Security Monitoring (NSM) tool-based observation of network activity to analyze session information along with log files and NSM data in this lab. This particular lab investigates NetFlow records together with Syslog and AAA protocol logs to study network operational activities. The education focuses on device configuration for Syslog server log transmission and entry logging with various severity levels and realizes analysis with NetFlow traffic assessment data. Syslog functions as a tool for event monitoring and students learn AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) to log user access. The experimental setup allows students to understand the role of NSM tools by showing security analysts how they track down malware and attacks through network traffic anomalies.

Lab 3: ARP Cache Poisoning

The ARP cache poisoning attack receives exposure through this lab as attackers use ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache manipulation to redirect network traffic toward themselves. Attackers function as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) in this scenario to intercept data movements between connected devices. The students discover how the attacker intercepts FTP traffic between a client and server by simulating the attack with Ettercap and Arpspoof tools. The lab demonstrates real-time packet sniffing with Wireshark together with examinations of ARP poisoning prevention methods which include DAI, Port Security, and IP Source Guard.


Lab 4: Snort and Firewall Rules

This laboratory outlines the basics of Snort which operates as a security surveillance system through established rules to detect security violations. The students master Snort operation through command configuration to record network activity which enables them to detect harmful activities. The course demonstrates iptables operation for Linux firewall systems alongside mutual rule-setting procedures for network protection. Students apply Snort for real-time alert monitoring of network traffic and configure iptables as a firewall to block identified malicious activities from IDS alerts. Building a multi-tier defense system that detects and interrupts security threats becomes possible through the combination of firewalls with Snort. Students analyze tcpdump logs to understand network security mechanisms better while they also refine firewall rules that derive from IDS alerts.

Lab 5: DHCP Starvation and DNS Poisoning

The lab centers around DHCP starvation coupled with DNS poisoning attacks which happen when attackers melt down the IP address resource pool or guide DNS queries to criminal servers. Students learn about such attacks through practical demonstrations of Yersinia Metasploit and Ettercap as the tools that attackers utilize for network communication takeover. The exercise guides students through DHCP starvation attack methods for IP address exhaustion and continues with rogue DHCP server installation and DNS spoofing for phishing site redirection. Students conduct practical exercises using the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) during the lab to create false websites because attackers easily manipulate user information disclosure through deceptive tactics. The protection of the network requires students to implement security measures which include DHCP Snooping alongside Port Security and IEEE 802.1X authentication so they can understand these safeguards' ability to defend against unauthorized access and traffic manipulation.
