# Network-Security-And-Forensics
This series of labs focuses on network security and forensics, providing hands-on experience with various security tools and techniques used in modern network environments. The labs explore key concepts like network monitoring, attack simulations, and the implementation of mitigation techniques for network vulnerabilities.

Lab 2: NetFlow and Syslog Analysis

In this lab, students use Network Security Monitoring (NSM) tools to observe network behavior, focusing on session information, log files, and other NSM data. The lab specifically delves into NetFlow information, Syslog, and AAA logs to gain insights into network operations. Key objectives include configuring devices to send logs to a Syslog server, enabling and capturing log entries at different severity levels, and analyzing network traffic using NetFlow data. Students also explore Syslog to monitor system events and configure AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) logging for user access. This lab helps students understand how NSM tools aid security analysts in detecting attacks and malware by identifying anomalous network traffic and suspicious events.

Lab 3: ARP Cache Poisoning

This lab demonstrates the ARP cache poisoning attack, in which an attacker manipulates the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache on network devices to intercept or redirect traffic. In this attack, the attacker acts as a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), gaining access to sensitive data transmitted between devices. Students simulate the attack using tools like Ettercap and Arpspoof and observe how the attacker can intercept FTP traffic between a client and a server. The lab includes real-time packet sniffing using Wireshark and discusses potential mitigation techniques like Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), Port Security, and IP Source Guard to prevent ARP poisoning and its associated risks.

Lab 4: Snort and Firewall Rules

This lab introduces students to Snort, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects security violations based on predefined rules. Students learn to configure and run Snort to capture and analyze network traffic, identifying malicious activities. The lab also covers the use of iptables, a Linux-based firewall, to define rules for network security. Students work with Snort to monitor real-time alerts generated by network traffic and configure iptables to block malicious traffic based on alerts from the IDS. The lab demonstrates how Snort and firewalls can be used together to create a layered defense system that identifies and blocks security threats. Students also analyze tcpdump logs and tune firewall rules based on IDS alerts, gaining a deeper understanding of network security mechanisms.

Lab 5: DHCP Starvation and DNS Poisoning

The focus of this lab is on DHCP starvation and DNS poisoning attacks, where attackers flood the network with DHCP requests to deplete the pool of available IP addresses or redirect DNS queries to malicious servers. The lab demonstrates how attackers can use tools like Yersinia, Metasploit, and Ettercap to carry out these attacks and gain control over network communication. Students simulate a DHCP starvation attack to exhaust the available IP address pool, followed by setting up a rogue DHCP server and DNS spoofing to redirect users to a phishing site. The lab includes hands-on experience with the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) to create and deploy fake websites, demonstrating how easily attackers can trick users into revealing sensitive information. To mitigate these attacks, students implement security measures such as DHCP Snooping, Port Security, and IEEE 802.1X authentication, learning how these mechanisms protect the network from unauthorized access and traffic manipulation.
